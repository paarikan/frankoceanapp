                    <p>Co-Star is an astrology app created by a small team in Brooklyn with a focus on modern design and a clever viral mechanism that has led to quick growth.</p>

                    <p>In this document, I'll go through why, whether you personally enjoy it or not, astrology is a significant and growing market with a particularly desirable demographic and how Co-Star is well poised to become a dominant brand in the sector.</p>

                    <h1>I. Market</h1>
                    <p>There are two key understandings to the astrology market. First, the population of people who believe in or engage with astrology is growing to peak levels and second, it has a particularly strong concentration among young women who act as tastemakers and have already made it a billion dollar industry.</p>


                    <h2>i. Increasingly accepted religion substitute</h2>
                    <p>Astrology is seeing its biggest boom in public consciousness since its most recent heyday with the New Age movement of the 60s and 70s. Over 90% of Americans know their main astrological sign. It is a perfect storm of social conditions that has led to this rise. Younger generations are demonstrably more stressed than older generations; this is often attributed to factors such as worsening economic inequality and a more hostile political climate.
                        At the same time, they are less likely to believe in traditional religions while being more likely to believe in a scientific basis for astrology. The compatibility of modern values and astrology has allowed it to partially fill the vacuum being left by religion at a time when young people are feeling particularly vulnerable to psychic turmoil.</p>
                    
                        <div class="img-wrapper">
                                <img src="astrologyrates.png">
                            </div>
                    <p>Astrology as a substitute for religion arises naturally in this case. It avoids conflicting with commonly accepted science by not offering a creation myth,
                        and offers other elements essential to religion such as ritual via the reading of a daily horoscope and a moral code via prescriping strengths and flaws to individuals by their star signs. Religions arise to explain the unexplainable. While people largely feel comfortable with science's ability to explain physical nature, many people still feel uncertain in science's ability to explain our personalities. 
                        Astrology excels for our current condition because the explanations it offers target that issue directly.</p>


                    <h2>ii. Consumer witchcraft lifestyle</h2>
                        <div class="img-wrapper">
                            <img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64947efbd9f01bf9a3ab1f2f3621eb9ff646627c/23_40_1675_1005/master/1675.jpg?width=620&quality=45&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&dpr=2&s=08340b369ed0778b156151ac11858ace">
                        </div>
                        <p>It is important to understand this modern astrology, and the modern religion it is a part of, as a larger lifestyle I'll refer to as "consumer witchcraft". This consumer witchcraft includes practices such as
                        using crystals, burning sage, reishi mushrooms, as well as many post-goth beauty trends. The core tenet is that a witch is a God in her own world, and her sacred practices serve to better understand and care for herself.
                        It is not difficult to see how that is particularly appealing to young women grappling both with a loss of belief in traditional institutions as well as increased expectation of personal empowerment.</p>

                        <p>There is nowhere this concentration among young women is clearer than on Instagram. There are a plethora of popular accounts on the platform dedicated to astrology memes which users delight in sharing with their friends.</p>

                        <p>There are real dollars behind this market as well. The "psychic services" industry, comprising of astrology, tarot, and palm reading among other practices, is estimated to be worth $2 billion dollars and growing.
                        That doesn't even include the adjacent products services I mentioned above that fall into the larger witchcraft lifestyle. The beauty angles of the industry alone should be fertile ground for creating value.</p>

                    <a name="ii"></a> 
                    <h1>II. Product</h1>
                    <h2>i. Overview</h2>

                    <p>Co-star's uniquely services this young, tech-savvy demographic. In the image below you can see how the app's onboarding design on the left differs from those of the top competitors in Google and App Store search rankings. By offering a modern, professional aesthetic, the app caters to the scientific and aspirational sensibilities of the market.</p>

                    <div class="img-wrapper">
                        <img src="costarcomp.png"/>
                    </div>

                    <p>Once the simple onboarding form is completed, there are two core user experiences. The single-player experience where a user views their own charts and daily updates and a social experience where a user adds friends and checks their compatibility.</p>

                    <p>Both experiences make use of NASA star data to map your time of birth and the position of stars and planets to astrological traits and explanations. The compatability reports in the social network feature appear to be templatized but articles claim the company uses "AI" for the daily updates. If that "AI" refers to natural language synthesis, that would be a novel and impressive technology asset that would allow them to both efficiently scale the existing Western market as well as expand to countries with different astrological systems such as India and China without significant increases in content creation costs.</p>

                    <h2>ii. Virtuous flywheel</h2>
                    <p>There is an oft-quoted strategy from Chris Dixon of getting users to "come for the tool, stay for the network". This refers to building a single-player experience to capture users and then allowing them to build a network that compounds in value. An incredibly clever thing Co-Star did is flip this strategy to tap into an existing network behavior to grow the app and then using the single-player experience as a retention mechanism.</p>

                    <div class="img-wrapper">
                        <img src="costarflywheel.png"/>
                    </div>

                    <p>A popular part of astrology is comparing signs with others, as in the line "What's your sign?". By piggy-backing on your phone number social network and enriching it with your astrological data, Co-Star is able to embed itself in that comparison game. This kicks off a virtuous flywheel which drives growth.</p>

                    <p>Users of the app encourage their friends to download the app to compare signs. Those users now have the app and some percentage of them engage in the single-player experience of checking their daily horoscope updates. As these users continue engaging in this behavior, their appreciation for astrology grows. Once that appreciation has grown sufficiently, they become evangelists and re-start the cycle by recruiting a new set of friends.</p>

                    <p>III. Team</p>

                    <a name="iv"></a> 
                    <h1>IV. Potential Business Models</h1>
                    <p>There are a few monetization options Co-Star can exercise.</p>
                    <p>There is currently a single in-app purchase for $2.99 which allows a user to create a profile for a friend on the former's phone. 
                        This allows the user to check their compatibility without their friend needing to download the app.  
                        
                    <p>An additional in-app purchase option the company should explore is a daily horoscope subscription. 
                        Co-Star currently offers this for free, but they could limit the free option to once a week as a preview for this subscription.</p>

                    <p>Co-Star could also explore native advertising within their daily horoscopes. The ability to prescribe a mood to a person and then presenting a call to action could be a powerful advertising tool. The personal nature of horoscopes makes this an extremely high-risk action and I would not recommend it without careful consideration of what is acceptable.</p>
                    
                    <p>Co-Star is also well positioned to present e-commerce options. This could begin with astrology specific literature and sign related merchandise, but over time this could expand to be a hub for the entire realm of consumer witchcraft products including sage and incense, beauty products, crystals, and tarot.</p>
