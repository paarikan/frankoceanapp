                    <p>Co-Star is an astrology app created by a small team in Brooklyn with a focus on modern design and a clever viral mechanism that has led to quick growth.</p>

                    <p>In this document, I'll go through why, whether you personally enjoy it or not, astrology is a significant and growing market with a particularly desirable demographic and how the team behind Co-Star is well poised to become a dominant brand in the sector.</p>

                    <a name="i"></a> 
                    <p>I. Market</p>
                    <p>There are two key understandings to the astrology market. First, the population of people who believe in or engage with astrology is growing to peak levels and second, it has a particularly strong concentration among young women who act as tastemakers and have already made it a billion dollar industry.</p>

                    <p>Astrology is seeing its biggest boom since its most recent heyday with the New Age movement of the 60s and 70s. It is a perfect storm of social conditions that has led to his rise. Younger generations are demonstrably more stressed than older generations; this is often attributed to factors such as worsening economic inequality and a more hostile political climate.
                        At the same time, they are less likely to believe in traditional religions, while being more likely to believe in a scientific basis for astrology.</p>
                    
                    <p>Astrology as a substitute for religion arises naturally in this case. It avoids conflicting with religion by not offering a creation myth,
                        and offers other elements essential to religion such as ritual via the reading of a daily horoscope and a moral code via prescriping strengths and flaws to individuals by their star signs. If religions arise to explain the unexplainable,
                        astrology excels for our current condition because the average person is still unable to explain the basis for their own personality.

                        <p>It is important to understand this modern astrology, and the modern religion it is a part of, as a larger lifestyle I'll refer to as "consumer witchcraft". This consumer witchcraft includes practices such as
                        using crystals, burning sage, reishi mushrooms, as well as many post-goth beauty trends. The core tenet is that a witch is a God in her own world, and her sacred practices serve to better understand and care for herself.
                        It is not difficult to see how that is particularly appealing to young women grappling both with a loss of belief in traditional institutions as well as increased expectation of personal empowerment.</p>

                        <p>There is nowhere this concentration among young women is clearer than on Instagram. There are a plethora of popular accounts on the platform dedicated to astrology memes which users delight in sharing with their friends.</p>

                        <p>There are real dollars behind this market as well. The "psychic services" industry, comprising of astrology, tarot, and palm reading among other practices, is estimated to be worth $2 billion dollars and growing.
                        That doesn't even include the adjacent products services I mentioned above that fall into the larger witchcraft lifestyle. The beauty angles of the industry alone should be fertile ground for creating value.</p>
