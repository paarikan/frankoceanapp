                    <p>Co-Star is an astrology app created by a small team in Brooklyn with a focus on modern design and a clever viral mechanism that has led to quick growth.</p>

                    <p>In this document, I'll go through why, whether you personally enjoy it or not, astrology is a significant and growing market with a particularly desirable demographic and how Co-Star is well poised to become a dominant brand in the sector.</p>

                    <h1>I. Market</h1>
                    <p>There are two critical understandings to the astrology market. First, the population of people who believe in or engage with astrology is growing to peak levels and second, it has a particularly intense concentration among young women who act as tastemakers and have already made it a billion dollar industry.</p>


                    <h2>i. Increasingly accepted, similar to religion</h2>
                    <p>Astrology is seeing its biggest boom in public consciousness since its most recent heyday with the New Age movement of the 60s and 70s. Over 90% of Americans know their main astrological sign, almost half think astrology is somewhat or strongly scientific, and about 23% read their horoscope daily. It is particularly resonant among 18-24-year-olds where a perfect storm of social conditions has led to its rise. Younger generations are demonstrably more stressed than older generations which to macro-level trends such as economic prospects and political climate. At the same time, they are less likely than ever to believe in traditional religion.</p>
                        <div class="img-wrapper">
                                <img src="astrologyrates.png">
                            </div>
                    <p>Unlike traditional religions, astrology avoids conflicting with commonly accepted science by not offering a creation myth but offers other elements essential to religion such as ritual via the reading of a daily horoscope and a moral code via prescribing strengths and flaws to individuals by their star signs. Religions arise to explain the unexplainable. While people largely feel comfortable with science's ability to describe physical nature, many people still feel uncertain in science's ability to define our personalities. Astrology excels for our current condition because the explanations it offers with its pre-determined personality types directly address that issue.</p>


                    <h2>ii. Consumer witchcraft lifestyle</h2>
                        <div class="img-wrapper">
                            <img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64947efbd9f01bf9a3ab1f2f3621eb9ff646627c/23_40_1675_1005/master/1675.jpg?width=620&quality=45&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&dpr=2&s=08340b369ed0778b156151ac11858ace">
                        </div>
                        <p>It is important to understand this modern astrology, and the contemporary religion it is a part of, as a broader lifestyle I'll refer to as "consumer witchcraft." This consumer witchcraft includes practices such as using crystals, burning sage, consuming reishi mushrooms, as well as many post-goth beauty trends. The core tenet is that a witch is a God in her own world, and her sacred practices serve to better understand and care for herself. It is not difficult to see how that is particularly appealing to young women grappling both with a loss of belief in traditional institutions as well as increased expectations of personal empowerment.</p>

                        <p>There is nowhere this concentration among young women is more apparent than on Instagram. There are a plethora of popular accounts on the platform dedicated to astrology memes which users delight in sharing with their friends. Unlike most memes which deal with a few personality types, an astrology meme may target all 12 signs which makes it particularly viral.</p>

                        <p>There are real dollars behind this market as well. The "psychic services" industry, comprising of astrology, tarot, and palm reading among other practices, is estimated to be worth $2 billion and growing. That doesn't even include the adjacent products services I mentioned above that fall into the larger witchcraft lifestyle. The beauty angles of the industry alone should be fertile ground for creating value.</p>

                    <a name="ii"></a> 
                    <h1>II. Product</h1>
                    <h2>i. Overview</h2>

                    <p>Co-star uniquely services this young, tech-savvy demographic. In the image below you can see how the app's onboarding design on the left differs from those of the top competitors in the Google and App Store search rankings. By offering a modern, professional aesthetic, the app caters to the scientific and aspirational sensibilities of the market.</p>

                    <div class="img-wrapper">
                        <img src="costarcomp.png"/>
                    </div>

                    <p>Once the simple onboarding form is completed, there are two core user experiences. The single-player experience where a user views their own charts and daily updates and a social experience where a user adds friends and checks their compatibility.</p>

                    <p>Both experiences make use of NASA star data to map your time of birth and the position of stars and planets to astrological traits and explanations. The compatibility reports in the social network feature appear to be templatized, but articles claim the company uses "AI" for the daily updates. If that "AI" refers to natural language synthesis, that would be a novel and powerful technology asset that would allow them to both efficiently scale the existing Western market as well as expand to countries with different astrological systems such as India and China without significant increases in content creation costs.</p>

                    <h2>ii. Virtuous flywheel</h2>
                    <p>Co-Star does cleverly taps into an existing network behavior to grow the app and then using the single-player experience as a retention mechanism.</p>

                    <div class="img-wrapper">
                        <img src="costarflywheel.png"/>
                    </div>

                    <p>A popular part of astrology is comparing signs with others, as in the line "What's your sign?". By piggy-backing on your phone and Facebook social networks and enriching it with your astrological data, Co-Star can embed itself in that comparison game and kick off a virtuous flywheel which drives growth.</p>

                    <p>Users of the app encourage their friends to download the app to compare signs. Those users now have the app, and some percentage of them engage in the single-player experience of checking their daily horoscope updates. As these users continue engaging in this behavior, their appreciation for astrology grows. Once that appreciation has risen sufficiently, they become evangelists and re-start the cycle by recruiting a new set of friends. This viral growth loop has translated into consistently strong App Store ratings in the past 6 months.</p>

                    <div class="lrg-img-wrapper">
                        <img src="costarchart.png"/>
                    </div>
                    <a name="iv"></a> 
                    <h1>III. Potential Revenue</h1>
                    <p>There are a few monetization options Co-Star can exercise.</p>
                    <p>There is currently a single in-app purchase for $2.99 which allows a user to create a profile for a friend on the former's phone. The feature enables the user to check their compatibility without their friend needing to download the app.</p>
                        
                    <p>An additional in-app purchase option the company should explore is a subscription for the daily horoscope. Co-Star currently offers this for free, but they could limit the free option to once a week as a preview for this subscription.</p>

                    <p>Co-Star could also explore native advertising within their daily horoscopes. The ability to prescribe a mood to a person and then present a call to action could be a powerful advertising tool. The personal nature of horoscopes makes this an extremely high-risk action, and I would not recommend attempting it before careful consideration of what is acceptable.</p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Co-Star is well positioned to present e-commerce offerings. These could begin with astrology specific literature and sign related merchandise, but over time this could expand to be a hub for the entire realm of consumer witchcraft products including sage and incense, beauty products, crystals, and tarot supplies.</p>
                    <a name="v"></a> 
                    <h1>IV. Potential Roadmap</h1>
                    <h2>i. Improve daily horoscopes</h2>
                    <p>The daily horoscope view is currently ~6 screens long. There is a summary view at the top, but that only categorizes ten topics such as responsibility and love by sentiment. Taking that sentiment information and applying natural language synthesis to create a one-paragraph summary analogous to newspaper horoscopes could produce a product that is more enticing to those new to astrology.</p>
                    <h2>iii. Daily social readings</h2>
                    <p>The social aspect of Co-Star is essential enough to be alluded to in the name of the app, but it currently only exists a single time between users. Creating two-person daily horoscopes would allow the network effects of the app to encourage additional usage.</p>
                    <h2>iv. New markets</h2>
                    <p>Based on Google Trends data, the US is only the 10 most interested country in astrology.</p>
                    <div class="lrg-img-wrapper">
                        <img src="astrologymap.png"/>
                    </div>
                    <p>Co-Star could expand into new territories in three stages.</p>
                    <p>First, they can begin marketing the app in English speaking countries that use Western astrology such as the UK, Canada, and Australia.</p>
                    <p>Second, they can localize the app and begin marketing it in non-English countries that use Western astrology such as Spain, France, and Brazil.</p>
                    <p>Finally, they can apply their backend technology to new apps in countries that practice different systems of astrology such as India and China.</p>
                    <h2>v. Dating service</h2>
                    <p>Based on demand research, Co-Star may consider rolling out a dating service. Astrology serves a dual benefit in this space by both being a basis for making matches as well as being a common interest to bond over.</p>
